# **Sentiment Analysis on Customer Transcripts**

## **Project Overview**
This project implements a **sentiment analysis** pipeline to analyze sales and customer support transcripts. The objective is to extract actionable insights such as customer sentiment, reasons for contact, and satisfaction levels, providing businesses with an automated way to understand and improve customer interactions.

---

## **Features**
- **Sentiment Classification**: Identifies whether customer sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Call Reason Extraction**: Determines the purpose of the call (e.g., complaints, inquiries, cancellations, etc.).
- **Customer Satisfaction Analysis**: Assesses the customer's satisfaction based on the interaction.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provides suggestions to improve customer experience.
- **Model Utilized**: Pretrained **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers).

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `transformers` (for NLP models)
  - `pandas` (data manipulation)
  - `nltk` (text preprocessing)
  - `sklearn` (classification and evaluation)
- **Data**: Sample customer support transcripts.

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/sentiment-analysis-transcripts.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sentiment-analysis-transcripts
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Usage**

1. **Prepare Input Data**:
   - Place the transcript data in a `.csv` file with the required structure (e.g., `Sales Executive` and `Customer` dialogues in separate columns).

2. **Run the Analysis**:
   ```bash
   python analyze_transcripts.py
   ```
3. **View Results**:
   - Results are saved in the `output` directory as a `.csv` file. The output includes:
     - Sentiment classification.
     - Reason for contact.
     - Customer satisfaction levels.
     - Suggestions for improvement.

## **Sample Input/Output**

### **Input Example**
```plaintext
Transcript 1:
Sales Executive: "Good morning, thank you for contacting ABC Electronics. How can I assist you today?"
Customer: "Hi, I'm interested in buying the new 4K TV you have on sale, but I need more information about its features."
```

### **Output Example**
| Transcript ID | Sentiment   | Reason for Call   | Satisfaction Level | Suggestions                                   |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1             | Positive    | Product Inquiry   | Neutral            | Follow up with additional product details.   |
